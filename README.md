# Pastebot filters for transforming copied text for social media

Social media platforms (ùïè, Mastodon, Facebook, LinkedIn etc) typically do not allow posted content to be styled (in bold, italic etc).

One workaround for this limitation is to use prestyled Unicode characters in the posted plain-text content. And this is exactly what the `tmp/*.pastebotfilter` files will allow you to do with the `Pastebot` clipboard manager.

After adding these filters to your `Pastebot` configuration, simply:

1. Write your posts in plain text.
1. Copy the text to be styled.
1. Replace the text with the Unicode-styled version.
1. Post your message.

## Text formatting in `Copied` is very buggy

I don't recommend `Copied` for doing any sort of text transformation. This means that the `text-formatters/generator.ts` script is useless.

Indeed, although this project contains a Deno/TypeScript script for porting `Pastebot` filters to `Copied`, I have found `Copied`'s text formatting to be very buggy and full of undocumented limitations:

- There is an undocumented limit to the size of the JavaScript programs that implement the formatters.
- Unicode-styling does not work in `Copied`, these will be ignored.
- etc.
